AC HW 0
=======

todo: formalize the following description.

Note: if you want to commit many times, please use another repo under your name s.t. it takes your usage instead of the org's. 

Note: please do not make any modification under .github directory.

Bril (the Big Red Intermediate Language), is the intermediate representation (IR) we use in this course, you can find more description in [bril/README.md][brilreadme].
Bril exists in this repository as [submodule][gitsubm] to complete HW0. If you cannot see the [bril/README.md](bril/README.md) locally, please clone this repo recursively
```
git clone -r "url-of-repo"
``` 
Your task is the todo in [install_bril.sh](install_bril.sh), which asks you to install bril during GitHub Actions, like you did on your local machine.
